In the~subsequent chapters, the general principle allowing~\dots is first described, and~then there is an approbation on particular examples:~\dots and~\dots.


\textbf{The first chapter} is devoted to an overview of the subject area of modular technological equipment development.
The first section notes that the problem of reducing the cost of manufactured products has existed since the very concept of ``industrial production'' appeared, that is, at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, when the so-called ``Second Industrial Revolution'' took place. In terms of industrial production, this historic event was marked by the introduction of the Bessemer method of steelmaking in the 1860s, and the culmination of changes that allowed this process to be called a ``revolution'',---the spread of continuous production and production lines. In the era of steam engines, individual pieces of equipment did not have their own engine. Instead, a belt drive was used, which was driven by a long shaft, which passed through the entire workshop (or even several workshops) and was connected to a large steam engine.Of course, such an organization of the drive of the machines was the bottleneck of the entire production, which pushed the inventors and engineers to use autonomous electric motors. significantly expanded their capabilities and made it possible to create more complex layouts of machines that implement several main movements at the same time.

The second section presents the prerequisites for the emergence of modular equipment in production. In particular, it is shown that the first multifunctional universal metal-cutting machines appeared at the beginning of the 20th century and combined various functionalities for processing workpieces. However, all their functional blocks were located on one bed and, depending on the needs of production, could be installed or removed, forming various configurations of equipment. Moreover, many versions of such equipment did not even have such an opportunity and were focused on one configuration. On the other hand, a distinctive feature of many such machines was the ability to work on one machine for several workers at the same time, which naturally increased the productivity of the equipment, especially when working in small repair shops and in small-scale production.

The following multifunctional universal machines are given as examples of such equipment:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit{Dalton Combinantion Machine or Dalton's Combinantion Machine}. This model appeared in February 1923 and has been protected by numerous patents. The machine was originally marketed as ``of particular interest to garage and boat owners'' and was said to occupy ``a fifth of the area occupied by individual machines of the same type''. Despite the large number of processing modules, it was impractical to use all combinations at once on Dalton. The basis of the design was a 13-inch screw-cutting lathe, on which modules were attached from the headstock side, realizing the functions of a horizontal milling machine with a drive table measuring 24' $ \ times $ 7.5', and a combined vertical milling machine with a quill for drilling.
	\item\textit{Piho Combination Machine}---a combined universal machine, produced in the late 1940s by Hartensteiner Maschinenfabrik, was advertised by the manufacturer as a device to be used in repair shops. There were two sizes: the larger version had the possibility of adjusting the height of the rear center in the range from 175 to 300\:mm and the center-to-center distance equal to 1300\:mm; smaller (desktop version)---from 60 to 100\:mm and 180\:mm between centers, respectively. Both modifications could work as a lathe, as well as a horizontal and vertical milling machine.
	\item\textit {Adcock \& Shipley}. This highly versatile machine offers maximum flexibility and modularity compared to other similar machines. On an area of just 7 'x 3' for the larger model and 11'6' 'by 3'8'' for the smaller one, there was a screw-cutter module, a cylindrical module for internal and external grinding, a vertical/horizontal milling module, and a drilling module. and specialized modules for tool sharpening. Instead of the sliding or lifting beds and headstock that were used on many other machines of the same type, Ryder was built on the basis of a conventional lathe, with each individual module being autonomous and able (apart from the grinding module) to work in parallel with other modules. The device was originally designed for use on board a ship and fulfilled the various requirements set by the British Admiralty for this purpose.
\end{enumerate}

Further, the logical development of the Options for multifunctional machines---modular machines. Aggregate machines (AM) denote equipment that consists of standardized and special units, assembly units and parts. The share of specially manufactured units is less than the share of standardized and normalized units. combining all its units into a single unit (machine tool, working complex). For this unit, a \textit{general (monolithic)} control and monitoring system is always used. AU in the overwhelming majority of cases is used in \textit{large-scale and mass production}. machine tools were controlled by analogy with automatic machines, ubiquitous in the 60s and 70s, then CNC machines appeared.This, in turn, made it possible to use modular machines already in mass production. All modern modular machines are controlled by CNC, but in a single and small-scale production, this type of equipment is not used never used. On modular machines it is possible to carry out multi-tool and multi-position blade and abrasive machining of parts. The early representatives of modular machine tools could perform only one type of processing (mainly this type of processing was drilling and threading). Currently existing models can combine almost all technological operations for mechanical processing.

Based on the analysis of the characteristics of modular machines and their applicability in modern production, it was concluded that the unification and standardization of the AM is greatly complicated, i.\,e. because. the structure cannot be divided into blocks of equal capabilities and dimensions. In fact, the AM is a complex unified automatic machine, where each unit has several different designs, which in general gives a wide variety of equipment obtained in this way, but this equipment cannot be considered modular. AM units are not universal and can perform their functions only together with other units, the design of which took place simultaneously. Aggregate machines are unified only in connection dimensions and there is no central unit on which other units could be installed, thereby changing the main function of the equipment. It is also noted that, in the main, AM were and are used only for metalworking and have never been used for other types of processing. Today, due to their complexity and narrow focus, the speakers have lost their relevance even within the framework of mass production, however, the basic approaches themselves, which were the basis for their operation, can and should be used to create universal modular equipment for small-scale and single-unit production.

The third section presents the results of the analysis of academic developments in the field of modular technological equipment. The fundamental works of such foreign researchers as F.~K\"onigsberger, who proposed to call separate functionally complete units of technological equipment by the term ``module'', are considered. The monograph by Yoshimi Ito is also considered, in which the modular principle of designing metal-cutting equipment with numerical control is proposed and comprehensively investigated. This paper presents methods that can reduce the design time of such modular systems, improve the reliability of their operation, reduce operating costs and simplify maintenance and repair. The paper discusses the basics of modular design of technological equipment, the methodology for determining the characteristics of modular machine tools, describes examples of the use of modular machine tools. The principles of interaction of modules in informational terms and the method of testing modular equipment are also considered.

Separately, the work of O.\,I.~Averyanov is mentioned, in which a comprehensive assessment of the modular principle of construction of multi-purpose CNC machines, developed at the Moscow Experimental Research Institute of Metal-Cutting Machine Tools, is given. The author analyzes the development trends in the production of machine tools that are relevant for the period of the late 1980s, including various serial and experimental metal-cutting machines of both domestic and foreign production (unfortunately, the vast majority of this equipment has already been discontinued). The areas of rational use of multi-purpose machine tools using the appropriate mathematical apparatus are also indicated. In this work, many hypotheses related to the use of modular equipment in particular and small-scale production are described theoretically and algorithmically confirmed. It is noted that at the time of this writing, metal-cutting machines were the basis of the industry, therefore, other types of processing within the framework of the described modular structure were not considered by the author. Moreover, the concept of ``information technology'' did not yet exist at that time, therefore In its work, the CNC system is considered as some kind of automaton for the movement of working bodies in space (by analogy with automatic machines mechanically controlled by means of cams).

Also in this section, other modern approaches to the development and operation of modular equipment are considered, in particular, the works of V.\,V.~Vyatkin, I.~Svetik, M.~Bortolini, F.~Li, J.~Shen and others are analyzed. The review continues in the fourth section, where modern modular process equipment control systems are considered. The academic studies of such authors as S.~Grigoriev, L.~Bin, L.~Morales-Velasquez, S.~Ma, N.~Verba, J.~Han are considered.

The fifth section is devoted to the existing industrial analogs of the proposed modular platform. A number of criteria have been identified by which the considered equipment samples can be classified as modular. The first criterion for comparing---\textit{versatility of the working body}, that is, the ability to change the type of equipment through a simple changeover. The following equipment models are considered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit {Proxxon}---modular desktop machines with the ability to connect an external CNC unit.
	\item\textit{UNIMAT}---modular system ``6 in 1'', providing a set of modules for creating universal desktop machines with manual control, the possibility of using the CNC system is not provided. There is no possibility of combining the two operations without equipment changeover.
\end{enumerate}

The second parameter, which was used to compare with existing analogues---\textit{open hardware architecture}, which allows you to create new types of equipment without the need to create any additional transition blocks and the use of reverse engineering. The following equipment models are considered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit{Build Your Own CNC}. The project for the creation of universal prefabricated equipment with numerical control. It can be considered conditionally open, as there are commercial implementations of equipment built on this project.
	\item\textit{Shapeoko}. A completely open project for the creation of a three-dimensional portal-type platform. Of the obvious advantages of the project, one can single out the open source software created by the authors of the project, as well as completely open hardware specifications, including drawings, three-dimensional models and other technical documentation necessary for the independent implementation of the equipment developed by the authors.
\end{enumerate}

The last parameter selected for comparison---\textit{modular open architecture of the control unit} in conjunction with the open source microcode of electronic equipment. For this parameter, the only project was found---the modular smartphone Ara announced for 2015 by Google. Of course, it is difficult to compare a modular control system for CNC equipment and a mobile platform for creating phones and tablets, but here there is a commonality of approaches that can be extrapolated to a modular CNC system.

The sixth section examines current trends in the field of standardization and unification of modular equipment. The following approaches are described:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit {IEC 61499}. This standard was developed with a view to the widespread use of distributed automation. It includes several solutions to the basic problems of distributed automation systems. It can be said that IEC 61499 offers a design language package for distributed measurement and control systems, thereby bridging the gap between popular PLC programming languages ​​and distributed systems. According to the IEC 61499 model, a distributed system consists of hardware equipped with interfaces with the environment, such as data networks or physical equipment. A generic element in the architecture of software development in accordance with IEC 61499 is a function block. Function blocks can be used not only to describe the logic of decentralized control, but also to describe the structural components of devices, such as their interfaces. To combine multiple function blocks into an application, they are connected by event and data link arcs, so that the full functionality of a distributed control system can be represented in terms of function blocks and the connections between them.
	\item\textit{Standard Module Type Package (MTP)}. It is a generalized standard formalized in the document VDI/VDE/NAMUR 2658. Today it is used primarily for the automation of continuous production. Particularly in the manufacturing industry, modular manufacturing systems play a more important role due to their ubiquitous applicability. One of the brightest representatives of modular production in industrial automation is the Pac standard kML for packaging machines. While the concepts and business benefits of modular automation are similar, the requirements and current technical implementation of the module description and process orchestration differ across industries. This fact increases the necessary efforts to implement hybrid, that is, cross-industry applications. It is important that in accordance with the MTP standard, production modules can be from different manufacturers, since the functionality of the module is described in a vendor-independent manner. One part of the MTP describes the services that the module implements. These services include the automation of the module's field devices and the interaction of the field devices. Thus, the process can be started without the need to control individual field devices. Services are at the heart of modular process plants because they represent a new level in the automation hierarchy. In addition to this, the modular technological system contains a human-machine interface orchestration unit. The orchestration block interacts with the services that manage the field devices in the pods. Direct influence on field devices in automatic operating mode is not possible, which is the biggest difference from classical technological installations. Indirect addressing of field devices using services ensures the integrity of the module and protects the know-how of the module supplier.
	\item\textit{Mass Customization Concept}. The concept of Mass Customization also has a lot to do with modular hardware. As noted earlier, in modern production there is a tendency towards a shorter life cycle of manufactured products and a faster change in the nomenclature. The ultimate case of this direction is precisely mass personalization. In the case of mass personalization, manufacturers do not just reduce the serialization of batches of identical products, but as a result, they can move on to creating unique things created for a specific consumer. This is achieved by increasing the flexibility of production, when each individual unit of production will be manufactured according to an individual technological process, going through stages of the production cycle that are different from other similar products. Further, a situation may arise when the presence of continuously running production is not required at all. A significant reduction in the technological preparation of production will make it possible to fulfill orders for certain types of products as they become available. Of course, such flexibility is impossible when using classical approaches to technological preparation of production and modular equipment can be a good help in this direction.
